                <h3>Let's Get You Some Yen</h3>
<p>As you may be aware, Japan is a primarily cash-based society.</p>
<p>While this may seem like a step backwards to people used to using credit/debit cards with chips, Apple Pay, etc., I actually quite like it!</p>
<p>Japanese bills start at the equivalent of a $10 bill, not $1 or $5.</p>
<p>Those denominations are coins, <em>as they should be</em> in this day and age.</p>
<p><img alt="Japanese Coins" src="images/coins.jpg" title="bottom-middle is a 5"></p>
<p>Cash is more manageable since you won't have a wallet stuffed full of ones.</p>
<p>Just be sure to manage your coinage. To prevent 1/5/10-coins from accumulating, use them whenever you can.</p>
<p>Even if you don't have exact change, say, when making a 1,202 yen purchase, go ahead and pay 2,002 yen if you have two one-yen coins.</p>
<p>Or maybe just buy lots of stuff from vending machines.</p>
<p><img alt="Vending Machine" src="images/vending.jpg" title="this one is weird cheap"></p>
<p><em>Side note:</em> sales tax used to be included in all the prices that you'd see while out &amp; about, but in 2014 the rate was raised to 8% and it ceased to be included. Now it's like what you're used to here. Phooey!</p>
<p><em>Another side note</em>: you don't <em>have</em> to use cash all the time in Japan-- <a href="http://youinjapan.net/moving/suica_pasmo_icoca.php">prepaid IC cards</a> double as train passes and most people in metropolitan areas have them.</p>
<h3><em>I digress.</em></h3>
<p>Action plan for money:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Call your bank!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A few days prior to departure (it's too early now), call &amp; let them know that you'll be in Japan.</p>
<p>Don't want to get flagged for fraud just when you need that withdrawal most.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Withdraw money from ATMs in Japan</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is what I've always done, and consensus seems to hold that this is how you get the best exchange rates.</p>
<p>Seven Bank ATMs (found in every 7-11) and Post Office Bank ATMs (found in every... post office) can withdraw from foreign accounts.</p>
<p>(I'd always used CitiBank ATMs personally, but <a href="http://www.findmyciti.com/jp/">they are no more</a>. <em>I think</em> I've used a Seven Bank ATM for this purpose before, though.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sevenbank.co.jp/intlcard/card2.html">Seven Bank International ATM Service Page</a></p>
<p><img alt="Seven Bank ATM" src="images/7bank-atm.jpg" title="I have never used the phone"></p>
<p><a href="http://www.jp-bank.japanpost.jp/en/ias/en_ias_index.html">Post Office International ATM Service Page</a></p>
<p><img alt="Post Office Bank ATM" src="images/yucho-atm.jpg" title="co-op atm where your most valuable resource is teamwork"></p>
<p>We'll be arriving to Narita terminal 2. <a href="https://www.narita-airport.jp/en/service/svc_12">Both banks have ATMs there</a>, so you'll be able to immediately make withdrawals.</p>
<p>Notes on ATM usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can use them (Seven Bank and Post Office Bank ATMs, at least) in English.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was apparently an international ATM scam making the rounds in late 2016, which has resulted in a 50,000-yen daily withdrawal limit (~$500). I figure that ~$1,000/day between the two banks will be plenty. If any of you are bigger ballers than I realize, I dunno, maybe bring your black card or just have your financial advisor look into this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Japanese ATMs have <em>hours</em>. Sometimes they simply cannot be used, other times they have increased fees (weekends, late-ish night). It isn't really worth worrying about, but is notable in being somewhat <em>bizarre</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I won't be exchanging any money prior to arriving to Narita.</p>
<p>Exchanging within the US is apparently pretty ugly, rate-wise (I've never even done it), and there's no particular reason to use a currency exchange service in Chicago (or Narita) since you'll have access to these ATMs in Narita anyway.</p>
<p>If worst comes to worst and you can't use either ATM for some reason (which I don't anticipate), you could visit a currency exchange in Narita.</p>
<p><img alt="Currency Exchange" src="images/exchange.png" title="if you must"></p>
<p>So maybe bring some backup dollars for that contingency.</p>
